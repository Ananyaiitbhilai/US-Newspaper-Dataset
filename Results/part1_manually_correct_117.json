(AP) \u2014\nThe body of former President\nLyndon Baines Johnson will be\nflown to Washington to lie in\nstate in the Capitol rotunda and\nreceive the nation\u2019s final trib-\nute.\n\nJohnson, whose dreams of a\nGreat Society were dampened\nby divisions at home over a\nwar in Asia, died Monday of a\nheart attack at 64.\n\nJobnson\u2019s coffin will be car-\nried on a horse-drawn caisson\nin & procession to Capitol Hill\nWednesday afternoon. A cere-\nmony will be held in the ro-\ntunda..\n\nFuneral services will be held\nThursday in Washington\u2019s Na-\ntional City Christian Church,\nafter which the body will be re-\nturned to Texas for burial in\nthe family cemetery of the LBJ\nRanch. .\n\nBefore the body of the na-\ntions 36th president is flown to\nWashington, it will lie in state\nfrom noon CST today until 8\na.m. Wednesday at the LBJ Li: brary in Austin, Tex. There will\nbe a full honor guard.\n\nJohnson was pronounced\ndead at 5:43 p.m. EST Monday\naboard his private plane at San\nAntonio International Airport.\n\nThe sudden attack ended a\ndistinguished public career\nwhich saw Johnson rise from\nsimple Texas roots to both\nhouses of Congress, to the pow-\nerful post of Senate Democratic\nleader which earned him the\nreputation as a masterful politi-\ncian, to the vice presidency and\nfinally to the presidency after\nthe assassination of John F.\nKennedy in 1963.\n\nAs the first Southerner to\nhold the presidency since An-\ndrew Johnson, his accom-\nplishments in the domestic\nfields of civil rights, Social Se-\ncurity, education and housing\nwere highly praised. He was\ncredited with pushing through\nsocial programs Democrats had\nbeen trying to enact since the\nNew Deal days of Franklin D.\nRoosevelt. When Johnson inherited the\npresidency, he inherited the\nwar in Indochina. Following his\nelection\u2019 as chief executive in\n1964 by a landslide margin, he\ngreatly expanded the U.S. in-\nvolvement in Indochina and op-\nposition to the war mounted at\nhome. The war eventually was\na major factor in his dramatic\nannouncement in March of 1968\nthat he would sot seek re-elec-\ntion.\n\nOn Monday, 51 minutes be-\nfore he was pronounced dead,\nSecret Service agents respond-\ning to his pleas found Johnson\nsiumped on the bedroom floor\nof his ranch in Johnson City\n\n+ and began a desperate 85-mile\ntrip by air to Brooke Army\nMedical Center here in hopes of\nsaving his life.\n\nCol. L.R. Hieger, chief of pa-\nthology at Brooke, performed\nan autopsy on Johnson\u2019s body\nlate Monday night and listed\nthe official cause of death as\ncoronary thrombosis:\n\nHieger\u2019s autopsy showed that the former president had se-\nvere coronary artery disease,\nwith complete occlusion \u2014 clo\nsure \u2014 of two of three .major\narteries to the heart. A third\nartery was about 60 per cent\noccluded.\n\nThe former President had a\nhistory of heart trouble dating\nto 1955. He suffered what was\ntermed as a major heart attack\nin April 1972 and was hospi-\ntalized with chest pains last\nJuly.\n\nWith him at death were three\nSecret Service agents, Dr. Da-\nvid J. Abbott of Johnson City,\nthe plane\u2019s pilot and the wife of\nthe foreman of the sprawling\nLBJ ranch, to which he retired\nafter leaving the White House.\n\nAs Johnson was flown to San\nAntonio, his wife, Lady Bird,\nwas contacted by radio tele-\nphone in a car about a block\nfrom the LBJ Library, about 80\nmiles from the family ranch.\nShe immediately went by heli-\ncopter to San Antonio, arriving\n\n(See LBJ, Page 17)",

Gorden Liddy first\nbroached the plans for 1972 political\nespionage it was \u2018ta complete horror\nstory\u201d that involved wiretaps, call girls\nand code names.\n\nInhindsight, Mitchell testified, he not\nonly should have thrown Liddy \u201c\u2018out of\nthe office, I should have thrown him out\nof the window.\u201d\n\nMitchell said he had rejected earlier\nversions of the Liddy espionage plan\ntwice prior to the March 30 meeting.\n\nHe said he could not explain the\ntestimony of \u2018any witness bul himself,\n\nDash then asked why, if Mitchell in\nfact vetoed the plan, Magruder would\nhave told campaign aide Robert\nReisner to relay word to Liddy that it\nhad been approved; and would have\ntold campaign treasurer Hugh W.

LaRue has pleaded\nguilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice\nin the Watergate cover-up,\n\nLaRue has said he had no knowledge\nof the approval of the wiretap plan at\nthe March 30 meeting.\n\nMitchell testified that the million-\ndollar spy plan Liddy initially proposed\non Jan. 27, 1972, \u2018just was beyond the\npale,\u201d\n\nMitchell said \u201cI told him to go burn\nthe charts.\" He said he told Liddy and\nMagruder then that the Nixon cam-\npaign was interested in information\nsathering and protection against\nJemonstrators, not in such a spy plan.\n\nHe also said \u201cI violently disayree\u201d\nwith Magruder's earlier testimony that\npn Feb, 4, 1972, the then-attorney\nzeneral was involved in discussions of\nDemocratic headquarters as a target\nfor electronic surveillance.\n\nMitchell said he made major\nlecisions about Nixon\u2019s re-election\n-ampaign while he was still head of the\nJustice Department,\n\nMitchell, testifying under subpoena,\nsaid Nixon had asked him \u201cto keep an\neye on the (campaign) committee, to\nsee that they didn\u2019t get out of line over\nthere.\u201d\n\nThe former Cabinet officer thus\nappeared to contradict his own\nprevious testimony before the Senate\nJudiciary Committee, where he\ntestified on March 15, 1972 that he had\n\u201cno re-election campaign responsi-\nbilities.\u201d\n\nMitchell said today thal he saw\nfrequent memoranda about such things\nas state presidential primaries,\nbudgets, and hiring of personnel.\n\nAt the start of his testimony at the\n\n(Concluded On Page 10)",

It boosts but slightly the\nnumber who may enter this coun-\ntry annually,\n\nThe Senate, following the lead of\nthe House the day before, overrode\nthe President's veto by a vote of\n57 to 26.\n\nTOPPED BY ONE VOTE\n\nA two-thirds majority was re-\nquired. With 83 senators voting,\nsupporters of the legislation topped\nby one the 56 votes needed.

The quotas would be di-\nvided among 85 nations and areas.\nLARGEST QUOTAS\n\nEngland, Ireland and Germany\nwould continue to have by far the\nlargest quotas. Truman and other\nopponents of the bill protested that\nthis discriminated against South-\nern and Eastern Europeans.\n\nThe legislation also would re-\nmove present barriers to the im-\nmigration of Orientals, although\nstrictly limit the number to be ad-\nmitted, give preference to aliens\nwith special skills, and establish\nnew grounds for the exclusion and\ndeportation of aliens.\n\nMcCarran told the Senate the in-\nternal security of the nation would\nbe destroyed if the \u2018floodgates\u2019\nwere opened for the entry of un-\nscrecned immigrants from all over\nthe world. .\n\nThe bulky new bill is the result\nof three years of study, financed\nby a $300,000 fund voted by Con-.\nsress for the purpose.",

There has\nbeen unofficial talk the first one\nmight be tried out this fall in Eni-\nwetock tests.\n\nDIDN'T APPROVE\n\nDespite the report by top Air\nForce and Pentagon leaders that\nWorld Wer III_may be brief but\nterrible, due to Russian atomic and\nair progress, the House refused to\ngo along with President Truman\u2019s\nrequest for $3,191,000,000 in new\natomic funds,\n\nit voted instead $1,485,000,000 to\nbegin a large-scale expansion of\natomic energy facilities. .\n\nThe House-also rebuffed the-AEC\nand the joint Senate-House Atomic\nCommittee by refusing to grant\nthe AEC authority to go ahead\nwith expansion projects not cov-\nered by available funds.\n\nBoth votes are subject to recon-\nsideration later.\n\nFEW SHORT WEEKS\n\nThe grim report by Twining and\nSecretary of the Air Force Fin-\nletter to senators included these\nhighlights:\n\nExpert opinion is that another\nall-o&t war, with atomic weapons,\nwould be decided in a few short\nweeks or months\u2014not years.\n\nIntelligence reports indicate Rus-\nsia now has at least twice as many\nfirst-rate combat aircraft organized\nin units as the United States. The\nfigures: about 20.00C Russian air-\ncraft in 250 wings; 10,000 for the\nU.S., with 733 wings planned by\n1955.

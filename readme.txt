1) The code folder contains 3 ipynb notebooks for each challenge. 
All the images/htmls with proper name are saved in the folder Results, they start with the name part3_ . 
2) part_1_manually_corrected_117.json is the dataset which I use for the upcoming challenges. This json file has no missing headings as only 7 articles had missing headlines, which I corrected manually. The part1_orig_119.json is the file which was expected in challenge1 (with missing headlines)
3) part_2.json has embeddings stored for original text, headlines, summary of article text, cleaned article text, cleaned article text with appropriate headings of the corresponding columns
4) Report contains every details. Code is also organized properly for easy understanding and replication.
